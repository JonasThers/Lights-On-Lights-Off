# Lights-On-Lights-Off

To explain the setup: There were two artefacts, both connected to each their lamp. On both artefacts there were sensors where one with the help of fingers could control the warmth and intensity of the light of the given lamp. When the two artefacts were put together, then both lamps would shine the same light - a combination of both light settings of both lamps before the artefacts were put together
